I've worked in the trades for the last 10 years.  I have worked in HVAC, metal fabrication, and automotive repair.  After immeasurable damage to my mind and body I chose to pursue a different career.  Naturally I am a creative thinker, I love to solve problems.  Growing up in the beginning stages of the internet, building my own PC the day I could hold a screwdriver - the tech industry was an obvious consideration.  I am by no means experienced at any of this, but one day I hope to achieve great things and engineer my own products.  This blog is to serve beginner developers such as myself, and to track my struggles and progress.  I hope to update this regularly and provide useful insights into my journey to change my career.
